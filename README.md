# Technologies used
Java Swing: The code uses the Java Swing library to create the graphical user interface (GUI) components, such as JFrame, JMenuBar, JMenu, JMenuItem, and JDesktopPane.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): AWT is used as the underlying framework for creating and managing the GUI components in the Java Swing library.

JFrame: The javax.swing.JFrame class is extended to create the main window of the application, which acts as the container for other GUI components.

JDesktopPane: It is a container used to hold internal frames, allowing multiple documents or components to be displayed within the main window.

JMenuBar, JMenu, and JMenuItem: These classes are used to create the menu bar, menus, and menu items respectively, providing a structured way to organize the application's functionalities.

ActionEvent and ActionListener: The code implements ActionListener interfaces and handles ActionEvents to respond to user interactions with the menu items, such as clicking on "Add Customer," "Search Customer," "Add Flight," "Book Flight," "View Ticket," and "Add Admin."

Overall, the code demonstrates the usage of Java Swing, AWT, JFrame, and related components to build a GUI application with menu options, internal frames, and event handling capabilities for an airline project.
